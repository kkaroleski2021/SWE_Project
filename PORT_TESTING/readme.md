You need to move this folder out of the main project to be able to mess with it

Important notes:  
  - You have to go to **localhost:9000** to be able to get json data from the backend and view the frontend simultaneously
  - localhost:4200 (angular one) will show you the frontend. but something is wrong with connecting to the backend. who cares since  :9000 works
  - going directly to paths (eg localhost:9000/page1) will **NOT** show the frontend. Still working on that .. shouldn't be to hard of a fix

## Issues to Address
- Our website will need to have an organized home page where students can easily navigate to different catagories of items; perhaps a tagging system or several subcategories that allow the user to sift through the sheer amount of objects
- Our website needs to have an appealing home page that will attract students
- Our website needs to have some sort of map functionality that allows buyers to see who's offering what closest to them
- Our website will need to allow users to search for specific items. 


## Issues Successfully Completed
- A searching functionality foundation has been set. Searches are saved from POST commands and are retrievable through GET commands. Previous searches are also stored so that a user may see their entire search history. 

## Incomplete Issues
- Our website is still very much in its infancy stage. In order to progress as a team and ensure Swampy Sells is able to come to fruition under the timeframe,
 we will need to solidify which frameworks we are using and figure out how to connect everything together.

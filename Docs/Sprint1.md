## Issues to Address
- Our website will need to have an organized home page where students can easily navigate to different catagories of items; perhaps a tagging system or several subcategories that allow the user to sift through the sheer amount of objects.
- Our website needs to have an appealing home page that will attract students.
- Our website needs to have some sort of map functionality that allows buyers to see who's offering what closest to them.
- Our website will need to allow users to search for specific items. 
- Our website will need to verify that a user is in fact a UF student, perhaps by inquiring for a UFID and ensuring that it is valid or mandating that the domain name is of "ufl."


## Issues Successfully Completed
- A searching functionality foundation has been set. Searches are saved from POST commands and are retrievable through GET commands. Previous searches are also stored so that a user may see their entire search history. 
- A home page has been implemented and includes a catchy title, logo, footer, and subcatagories.
- The backend team has written code to get, post, put, and delete user data.

## Incomplete Issues
- Our website is still very much in its infancy stage. In order to progress as a team and ensure Swampy Sells is able to come to fruition in the specified timeframe,
 we will need to solidify which frameworks we are using and figure out how to connect everything together. We have yet to populate a functional database, ensuring
 that any PUT or POST requests add that specific user to the database and that a DELETE and UPDATE request delete that user or updating their corresponding data in the database, respectively. 
 - Although the website includes subcatagories, they do not link to any extra data. In the next sprint, we will need to link subcatagories to different pages of the website.
 - The frontend team is having difficulty with centering text. Before the next sprint, we want to figure out the cause of this issue and fix it.

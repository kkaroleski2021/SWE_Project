## Project Description
**Swampy Sells** is an online shop similar to that of eBay dedicated solely for college students to use, in which items such as textbooks and furniture would be sold. Users would be able to post items to sell and privately message each other. Users would be able to make an account using only their UF email to verify their enrollment. There will
also be a map feature on the website so that students can locate nearby vendors. 

## User Stories
- As a college student, I want to be able to easily find common college items secondhand, such as books, so that I can save money and time. 
- As a college student, I want to be able to buy from other students because I would feel more comfortable meeting another student rather than a random person or someone posing as a student. 
- As a college student, I want a hub to sell all of my old stuff quickly and easily, so that I don't have to waste time advertising on all the different social medias. 
- As a college student, I want a dedicated place for students to sell tickets so that they do not have to spam every social media for 4 months straight.

## Project Description
**Swampy Sells** is an online shop similar to that of eBay dedicated solely for college students to use, in which items such as textbooks and furniture would be sold. Users would be able to post items to sell and privately message each other. Users would be able to make an account using only their UF email to verify their enrollment. There will
also be a map feature on the website so that students can locate nearby vendors.

- download angular
- to get the images on the website, add the images in assets into the my-angular-site folder
